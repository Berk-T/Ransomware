# Ransomware
A simple ransomware script written in python as part of my internship at National Keep.

The encryptor script encrypts the file system and leaves a note that has the instructions the victim should follow in order to decrypt their system.  
The decryptor script decrypts an encrypted file system if the system has the file needed for decryption.  
The decrypt_fernkey and private.pem files are used by the attacker to create a decryption key for the victim.
